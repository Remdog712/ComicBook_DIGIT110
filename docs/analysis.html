Day by Day doesn't actually have balloons because the text is not displayed in standard balloons but it is rather stored in captions below the actual image. NOTE: Dennis Ski Menace Ski should be "90" and not "9" for the count of balloons.

Dennis has the most overall, but actually, in "Gramp Story" and "Day By Day" have unique situations. "Grampa Story" is actually a spinoff containing 4 new characters and "Day By Day" is not represented as standard speaking balloons but the speech is contained in captions.

Wilson contained the most due to a sequence in "Dennis Ski Menace Ski" in which he was skiing downhill alone. Dennis and his Father are close in number due to most of the time whenever Dennis does an action his father is usually close behind to stop said action or to scold him for said action.
