            <h2>About Out Project</h2>
            <p>We wanted to find how The Simpsons TV show has changed over the years in the number of certain characters, phrases, and overall changes. We will do this by looking not at the entire collection but seasons 1,10,20, and 30 as they are 10 years apart each and could show monumental changes over the years. </p>

            <h2>The Simpsons</h2>
            <p>The Simpsons is an American animated sitcom television series that got its start as animated shorts in 1987. About two years later, the series as we know today debuted on December 17, 1989 and has been going on for over 30 years and now has, at the time of writing this, 34 seasons in total. Over its time on the air, the series has become a cultural phenomenon, known for its irreverent humor, satirical social commentary, and lovable characters. The show follows the lives of the Simpsons family, including Homer, the father, Marge, the mother, and their children Bart, Lisa, and Maggie, as well as a large cast of supporting characters from the town of Springfield. The show has won numerous awards and has been praised for its impact on pop culture and its influence on other animated series. Despite some controversies throughout the years, The Simpsons still remains one of the most beloved and iconic television shows of all time.

            <h2>Why?</h2>
            <p>We chose the Simpson because we were curious to find out how time has changed the series since it began in 1989 until more recently and how the series has progressed over the years.
